# WELCOME TO THE 'MAKE AN ARTICLE COPY ISSUE'

This GitHub issue has been created with two primary objectives in mind. The first is to establish a backup repository for all the cybersecurity blog articles written and published by ProfCyberNaught, over on the cybersecurity website. This task would involve visiting the primary website and creating backup copies of chosen articles within the repository.

The second objective is to provide an interactive learning opportunity for individuals new to GitHub. This can be accomplished by participating in the process of copying an article, following instructions and documentation, receiving support, having their work reviewed, and ultimately merging their contributions into the master branch. Through this initiative, newcomers can gain practical experience and improve their skills in using GitHub processes, contribute to a public repository, and get actively involved within the community.

<a name="limitations"></a>

## POTENTIAL LIMITATIONS FOR CONTRIBUTORS

Although this active repository welcomes newcomers to the GitHub platform and provides an opportunity for them to learn and grow, it is important to note that contributors should follow the guidelines and contribute in a genuine and meaningful way. It is not intended for individuals who solely want to increase their stats or gain notoriety by adding their name as a contributor without actually contributing to the project. Additionally, it is not acceptable for individuals to repeat pull requests for multiple articles without making substantial contributions or adding value to the project. The purpose of this active repository is to create a collaborative and productive environment for individuals to learn and grow in their skills and abilities, while also making a positive impact in the field of cybersecurity.

Additionally, it is important to note and be mindful of the repository's intended audience and purpose. In addition to being aimed at newcomers to the GitHub platform, it should be noted that the repository is designed to be a learning resource. As such, it is important to consider the limitations for more experienced contributors. While all are welcome to contribute, those who are not new to GitHub should think twice before doing so, and may want to comment on the issue first or communicate with ProfCyberNaught directly to ensure they are not taking opportunities away from newcomers.

Once a contributor has had a pull request accepted, the repository's goal is not to accept further submissions from that individual unless they have a specific objective in mind for learning and growing their knowledge with the support and agreement of ProfCyberNaught. Multiple submissions from the same contributor should be avoided, in order to leave opportunities open for others who are seeking experience and support.

As a contributor to this active repository, it is important to note that any changes made to the repository should only be limited to the files required and outlined in the detailed instructions and repository documentation. It is essential that any modifications are made following the provided steps, to ensure that the process is uniform and consistent. Deviations from the given instructions can cause confusion and hinder the contribution process. Therefore, it is highly encouraged to follow the guidelines strictly to maintain the integrity of the repository and ensure a positive contribution experience for all involved.

<a name="rejections"></a>

## POTENTIAL REASONS FOR PULL REQUEST REJECTIONS

Here are some of the reasons why a pull request could be rejected:

- The changes do not meet the quality standards outlined in the repository documentation.
- The changes are not relevant to the cybersecurity articles being copied.
- The changes violate the repository's code of conduct.
- The changes do not follow the licensing requirements outlined in the repository documentation.
- The changes are too similar to existing articles in the repository.
- The changes attempt to submit an article copy already completed by another contributor.
- The changes attempt to submit an article copy which has already been commented on within the issue _(i.e., another contributor has stated, they are attempting to copy that article)_
- The changes introduce security risks or vulnerabilities.
- The changes are not in line with the repository's goal of providing educational cybersecurity resources to beginners.
- The changes ignore specific instructions from or agreements made with ProfCyberNaught.
- Multiple pull requests for the same copied article.
- Multiple articles copied pull requests from the same contributor _(ideally aimed at newcomers and one article per contributor - this can be increased with the agreement and support of ProfCyberNaught)_

It's important for contributors to thoroughly read and follow the repository documentation and instructions to ensure their changes are accepted.

Contributors should limit themselves to one article per pull request, unless agreed in advance with ProfCyberNaught. Additionally, multiple pull requests from the same contributor will not be accepted, as the repository aims to give opportunities to as many contributors as possible.
