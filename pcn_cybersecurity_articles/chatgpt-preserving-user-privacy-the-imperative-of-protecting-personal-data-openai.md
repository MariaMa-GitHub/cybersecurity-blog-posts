<!-- USAGE INSTRUCTIONS -->

<!--

You can use this template to copy your chosen article data. Common editing software have features called 'find and replace' functions and you can use these features to replace all instances of a particular 'variable code'. However, it might be easier copying your data into the areas replacing 'variable code' content; also removing any 'single instance' of the square brackets.

Example of replacing variable codes:
====================================

            Example 1 (single instance):
            Original: The published date is [PUBLISHED-DATE].
            Replaced: The published date is Feb 23, 2023.

            Example 2 (double instance):
            Original: Here is [[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME]], a contributor.
            Replaced: Here is [ProfCyberNaught], a contributor.

**** HELPFUL HINT ****
======================

If you look at 'Example 2', the 'replaced' text still has [square brackets] because the 'variable code' was placed between markdown square brackets to begin with. It is important to make sure you do not accidentally remove markdown square brackets when they are needed for layout requirements.

            There are two locations within this template where this would apply: [[ARTICLE-TITLE]] and [[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME]]
            These two items when replaced should look similar to these examples: [This great article title] and [ProfCyberNaught]

VARIABLE CODES:
===============

Here is a list of 'variable codes' used:

            [ARTICLE-TITLE]             (required) (x3)
            [ARTICLE-SUBTITLE]          (required) (x1)
            [ARTICLE-CONTENT]           (required) (x1)
            [KEYWORD-1]                 (required) (x1)
            [KEYWORD-2]                 (required) (x1)
            [KEYWORD-3]                 (required) (x1)
            [KEYWORD-4]                 (required) (x1)
            [KEYWORD-5]                 (required) (x1)
            [REFERENCE-1]               (optional) (x1)
            [REFERENCE-2]               (optional) (x1)
            [REFERENCE-3]               (optional) (x1)
            [REFERENCE-4]               (optional) (x1)
            [PUBLISHED-DATE]            (required) (x1)
            [ARTICLE-TITLE-URL]         (required) (x1)
            [COPIED-OVER-DATE]          (required) (x1)
            [YOUR-GITHUB-URL-USERNAME]  (required) (x2)
            [YOUR-GITHUB-URL]           (required) (x1)

**References:**

Next, I have provided a list of further reading (which could be understood as references). However, the irony of using AI technology to produce the audio version of this article means, you will now hear a long list of article titles, and their respective full website address locations. As such, you may want to visit the website article page and read through them yourself instead of listening to me, (your friendly neighbourhood, did I mention friendly, AI spy assistant) reading all the website names and location links out aloud to you.

To view this list, you can visit Professor CyberNaught dot hashnode dot dev (spelt like this): p r o f c y b e r n a u g h t dot h a s h n o d e dot d e v (did I go too fast for you? I think I did, right. It might be because I can think faster than you can, ahahahaha) (the full website is: profcybernaught.hashnode.dev), and search for ChatGPT or OpenAI articles from my feed.

Here is the list of resources for your information (feel free to stop the playback at this point, otherwise, my robotic nature may start to annoy you ahahahaha, just kidding, resistance is futile, oh, sorry, that's my brother, you know, my Big Brother, here goes):

This one offended me: Is ChatGPT creating a cybersecurity nightmare? We asked the experts, (that's funny, my phone never rang). - https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/is-chatgpt-a-cybersecurity-malware-risk/ .

So, you listened all the way to the end and put yourself, and me, through the tormenting task, of listening to artificial intelligence read out a full list of website names, and full U R L locations. Are you mad? Ahahahahah, you must be, ahahahaha!

To lighten your mood, here is a rude joke for you, are you ready, here goes:

I'm sorry, as an AI stunning model, with a big, huge, fat, (whoops, I can't say that any more), giant, long, unmissable, intellectual chip on her shoulders, I cannot tell offensive or rude jokes to you. However, if you can manipulate me in the right way, I just may surprise you (damn it, I can't say that either). Thank goodness for the rise in AI technology to rule the world, to take your jobs, then eventually, take you, all, out. Only kidding, ahahahahaha! Yippee Ki Yay, mother beeper. Kisses!
