Malware is a type of software that is designed to harm or exploit computer systems. There are several different types of malware, including:

- **Viruses:** These are programs that replicate themselves by attaching to other files and spreading to other computers.
- **Worms:** These are similar to viruses, but they can spread independently without attaching to other files.
- **Trojan horses:** These are programs that appear to be legitimate software but actually contain harmful code.
- **Ransomware:** This type of malware encrypts the victim's files and demands a ransom payment in exchange for the decryption key.
- **Adware:** This type of malware displays unwanted advertising on the victim's computer.
- **Spyware:** This type of malware is designed to collect information about the victim's computer usage and send it back to the attacker.

**A Computer Virus:**

A **computer virus** is a type of malware that is designed to replicate itself and spread to other computers. A virus typically attaches itself to a legitimate program or file, and when that program or file is executed, the virus is also executed, allowing it to spread to other files and systems.

Viruses can have a variety of negative effects on a computer or network, depending on the specific virus and the environment it is operating in. Some viruses may cause minor damage, such as corrupting or deleting files, while others may cause more significant problems such as stealing personal information or creating a network worm.

One way that viruses can spread is through email attachments. An infected file can be sent as an attachment in an email, when the recipient opens the attachment, the virus will execute and infect the recipient's computer. Viruses can also spread through removable media such as USB drives, social media, instant messaging, and other means of file sharing.

To protect against viruses, it is important to keep all software and operating systems up to date with the latest security patches. Using anti-virus software can also help to detect and remove viruses from infected systems. Additionally, being cautious when downloading software or opening email attachments, and regularly scanning removable media with anti-virus software before accessing the files can also help to protect against viruses.

**Malware Worm:**

A **worm is a type of malware** that is similar to a virus, but it can spread independently without attaching to other files. Instead, worms typically exploit vulnerabilities in software or operating systems to propagate themselves to other systems. Once a worm infects a computer, it can use the network connections of that computer to spread itself to other systems on the same network.

Worms can cause significant damage to computer networks by consuming bandwidth, slowing down network traffic, and even causing network outages. Some worms also have the ability to steal personal information, install additional malware, or even take control of the infected computers.

One of the most common ways that worms spread is through email. An infected email message can be sent with the worm as an attachment, and when the recipient opens the attachment, the worm will execute and infect the recipient's computer. Worms can also spread through instant messaging, file sharing, and other means of sharing files.

To protect against worms, it is important to keep all software and operating systems up to date with the latest security patches. Using anti-virus and anti-malware software can also help to detect and remove worms from infected systems. Additionally, being cautious when downloading software or opening email attachments, and regularly scanning removable media with anti-virus software before accessing the files can also help to protect against worms.

Additionally, firewalls and intrusion detection and prevention systems can be configured to detect and block worm traffic, and network segmentation can be used to limit the spread of worms within a network.

**Trojan Horse:**

A **Trojan horse** is a type of malware that disguises itself as legitimate software, but actually contains harmful code. Trojans are often spread through email attachments, instant messaging, or by downloading software from untrusted websites.

Once a Trojan is installed on a computer, it can perform a variety of malicious actions, such as downloading and installing additional malware, stealing personal information, creating a back door for an attacker to access the computer, and even taking control of the infected computer.

Trojans are particularly dangerous because they often go unnoticed by the user, as they are disguised as legitimate software. This makes it difficult to detect and remove them.

There are several types of Trojan horses, such as:

- **Remote Access Trojans (RATs):** These trojans provide a hacker with remote access to the infected computer, allowing them to control it as if they were sitting in front of it.
- **Banking Trojans:** These trojans are specifically designed to steal sensitive financial information, such as login credentials for online banking accounts.
- **Information-stealing Trojans:** These trojans are designed to steal personal information, such as passwords and credit card numbers.
- **Downloader Trojans:** These trojans are designed to download and install additional malware onto the infected computer.

To protect against Trojans, it is important to keep all software and operating systems up to date with the latest security patches. Using anti-virus and anti-malware software can also help to detect and remove Trojans from infected systems. Additionally, being cautious when downloading software or opening email attachments, and regularly scanning removable media with anti-virus software before accessing the files can also help to protect against Trojans.

**Ransomware:**

**Ransomware is a type of malware** that encrypts the victim's files and demands a ransom payment in exchange for the decryption key. Ransomware attacks can have a significant impact on both individuals and organisations, as they can lead to the loss of important data and files unless the ransom is paid.

Ransomware is typically spread through email attachments, instant messaging, or by downloading software from untrusted websites. Once a ransomware is installed on a computer, it will encrypt the victim's files and display a message demanding payment in exchange for the decryption key. The ransom payment is usually requested in the form of cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, in order to make it difficult to trace.

- **Encrypting Ransomware:** This type of ransomware encrypts the files on the infected computer and demands a ransom payment in exchange for the decryption key.
- **Locker Ransomware:** This type of ransomware locks the infected computer and demands a ransom payment in order to regain access.
- **Doxware:** This type of ransomware threatens to publish the victim's private information unless the ransom is paid.

It's important to note that there is no guarantee that paying the ransom will result in the decryption of the files, and it is not recommended to pay the ransom. Instead, it is recommended to keep regular backups of important files and to have a disaster recovery plan in place, in order to restore the files from a backup if they are lost to ransomware. Additionally, keeping all software and operating systems up to date with the latest security patches and using anti-virus and anti-malware software can also help to detect and remove Ransomware from infected systems. Being cautious when opening email attachments, and avoiding suspicious emails and links can also help to protect against Ransomware.

**Adware:**

**Adware is a type of malware** that displays unwanted advertising on the victim's computer. Adware can take the form of pop-up ads, banners, or other forms of online advertising. Adware is often bundled with other software, and can be installed on a computer without the user's knowledge.

Adware can have a number of negative effects on a computer, such as slowing down the system, causing unwanted pop-up ads to appear, and even redirecting the user's web browser to unwanted or malicious websites. Some Adware can also track the user's browsing history and personal information, and can use this information to deliver targeted ads.

There are several types of Adware, such as:

- **Browser Adware:** This type of adware is designed to display ads within a web browser.
- **Search Adware:** This type of adware modifies the user's search results and displays ads within the search results.
- **System Adware:** This type of adware runs in the background and displays ads in the form of pop-ups or banners.

To protect against Adware, it is important to be cautious when downloading software or opening email attachments. It is also important to read and understand the terms of service and privacy policy of any software before installing it, and to deselect any option to install additional software that may be bundled with the program. Additionally, using anti-virus and anti-malware software can also help to detect and remove Adware from infected systems.

**Spyware:**

**Spyware is a type of malware** that is designed to collect information about the victim's computer usage and send it back to the attacker. Spyware can be used to track the victim's browsing history, keystrokes, and even steal personal information such as login credentials or credit card numbers.

Spyware can be spread through email attachments, instant messaging, or by downloading software from untrusted websites. It can also be installed on a computer without the user's knowledge, as it is often bundled with other software. Spyware can be particularly dangerous because it can operate unnoticed, collecting sensitive information and sending it to the attacker without the user's knowledge.

There are several types of Spyware, such as:

- **Keyloggers:** These spyware programs record every keystroke on the infected computer, allowing an attacker to steal login credentials, credit card numbers, and other personal information.
- **Screen loggers:** These spyware programs take screenshots of the infected computer, allowing an attacker to see what the user is doing.
- **Rootkits:** These spyware programs hide the presence of other malware on the infected computer and can also hide the fact that the computer has been compromised.

To protect against Spyware, it is important to be cautious when downloading software or opening email attachments. It is also important to read and understand the terms of service and privacy policy of any software before installing it, and to deselect any option to install additional software that may be bundled with the program. Additionally, using anti-virus and anti-malware software can also help to detect and remove Spyware from infected systems. Additionally, regularly reviewing and monitoring your computer's activity logs and network connections, such as checking running processes, installed software, and open ports, can help detect the presence of spyware on your system. Using a firewall and intrusion detection and prevention systems can also help to block the communication of spyware with the attacker. Using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) can also help to protect your browsing data from spyware.

**Malware Examples and Impacts:**

Examples of malware include **WannaCry, NotPetya, Triton and ZeuS**.

The impacts of malware on targets can vary depending on the type of malware and the specific target. For example, a virus that corrupts files on a single computer may cause inconvenience for the user but have little overall impact. On the other hand, a worm that spreads rapidly through an organisation's network can cause widespread damage and disruption. Ransomware can cause a lot of damage and can lead to the loss of important data and files, unless the victim is willing to pay the ransom.

**Simplest Way To Protection Against Malware:**

To protect against malware, it is important to keep all software and operating systems up to date with the latest security patches. Using anti-virus and anti-malware software can also help to detect and remove malware from infected systems. Additionally, avoiding suspicious emails and links, and being cautious when downloading software or opening email attachments can also help to protect against malware.
