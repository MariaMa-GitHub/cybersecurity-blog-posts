Open source and closed source software refer to the ways in which the source code of a program is made available to the public.

Open source software is software whose source code is made freely available to the public, meaning anyone can view, modify, and distribute the code. This allows for a community of developers to collaborate on improving the software. Examples of popular open source software include Linux, Apache, and WordPress.

Closed source software, on the other hand, is software whose source code is not made available to the public. This means that the code is proprietary and typically only available to the company or individual who created it. Examples of closed source software include Microsoft Windows and Adobe Photoshop.

One of the main benefits of open source software is that it is usually free to use and can be modified to fit the needs of the user. This allows for a wide range of users and developers to collaborate and improve the software for both security and privacy. Some open source software has thousands of developers working together to help improve it, and keep it within the public domain. However, open source software can sometimes lack the additional types of support and resources of closed source software depending on how large the project is, and if enough people use it.

Closed source software, on the other hand, typically offers more types of support and resources, such as customer service and regular updates. Additionally, closed source software is often seen and marketed as more secure since the source code is not publicly available (therefore, limiting the attackers knowledge of the inner-workings). However, closed source software can be more expensive and users are not able to modify the code to fit their needs. Also, closed source software can have security flaws and you would never know unless the developers held their hands up.

It's also worth mentioning that some closed source software is based on open source code. This means that the company or individual who created the closed source software may have used open source code as a starting point for their own software. An example of this would be Google's Android operating system, which is based on the open source Linux operating system. It is also common to have open source projects become popular (developed by the public) only to be hidden behind a paywall later on. In these instances, a fork of the open source software will be made and maintained as a different name.

In summary, open source and closed source software both have their own set of pros and cons. The choice between the two ultimately depends on the specific needs and priorities of the user or organisation. However, closed source software is held behind a paywall and using open source gives you access free of charge, with it being supported by the community.
