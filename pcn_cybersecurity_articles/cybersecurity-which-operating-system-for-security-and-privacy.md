The differences between Windows, Linux, and Mac, and which one would be better for a more secure and private online experience is an important questions and growing in demand recently.

When it comes to operating systems, there are three main options: Windows, Linux, and Mac. Each one has its own set of features and advantages, and the one that is best for you will depend on your specific needs. In this post, we will explore the differences between these three operating systems and discuss which one would be the best choice for a more secure and private online experience.

Windows is the most popular operating system in the world, and it is used by millions of people every day. It is known for its ease of use and compatibility with a wide range of software and hardware. However, Windows is not known for its security, and it is often targeted by hackers and malware. Additionally, Windows collects a lot of data about its users, which can be a concern for privacy. If we compared previous versions of Windows such as XP to Windows 11, you will see a big difference in the amount of data collection tactics which are hard-coded into the operating system.

Linux, on the other hand, is known for its security and privacy features. It is an open-source operating system, which means that its code is available for anyone to review and improve. This makes it less susceptible to security vulnerabilities, as any potential issues can be quickly identified and fixed by the community. Additionally, Linux does not collect as much data about its users as Windows does and this can be disabled very easily; unlike Windows which could brick your operating system if you tried. Linux comes in many different versions and a more security focused distro would be [QubesOS](https://www.qubes-os.org/ "QubesOS"). If you want a privacy focused version, you could try [TailsOS](https://tails.boum.org/install/index.en.html "TailsOS").

Mac is another popular operating system, and it is known for its sleek design and ease of use. Like Linux, Mac is also relatively secure, and it is not as commonly targeted by hackers and malware as Windows is. However, Mac still collects some data about its users, and it is not as customisable as Linux, and you may run into compatibility issues.

For the most secure and private online experience, Linux and its many different versions is probably the best choice. It is open-source, which means that it is less vulnerable to security vulnerabilities, and it also collects less data about its users than Windows or Mac. However, if you need to use specific software that is not available for Linux (many major software applications are only developed for Windows), or if you are more comfortable with the user interface of Windows or Mac (you can use a different desktop environment in Linux which looks very similar to Windows or Mac), those may be better options for you. However, you can use system themes to make operating systems look and behave like your preferred method, whilst still providing additional security and privacy measures.
