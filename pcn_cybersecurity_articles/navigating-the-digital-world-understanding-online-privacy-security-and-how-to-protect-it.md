<!-- CONTENT -->
Online privacy and digital security is a growing concern as technology continues to advance and more of our personal information is shared online. Advertisers, in particular, have been known to collect and use personal data without the knowledge or consent of the individual, and malicious actors have initiated malware (ransomware) to encrypt data and then demand monetary reward in order to decrypt the data. There is no guarantee the actors will provide the decryption keys or not share your data with other parties even if payment is made (normally sold multiple times over on the dark web).

### Security Definition

Security and privacy are two distinct concepts, but they are often used interchangeably and can be easily confused. Security refers to the measures taken to protect against unauthorised access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information. This can include physical security, network security, and data encryption.

### Privacy Definition

Privacy, on the other hand, refers to the ability of an individual or organisation to control the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information. This can include the use of privacy policies, data protection laws, and encryption.

The confusion between the two terms can lead to a false sense of security or privacy. For example, a company may claim to have strong security measures in place to protect customer data, but if they are collecting and sharing that data without consent or making the user aware of such practices, then there is no real privacy. Similarly, an individual may believe that their privacy is protected because they use encryption on their devices, but if they are connected to an unsecured network, their security is still at risk and data could be transmitted in plaintext formats; readable by anyone controlling the network (your ISP, your VPN provider and more).

In summary, Security is the protection of information and systems from unauthorised access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction, while privacy is the ability of an individual or organisation to control the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information. Both play important roles in protecting sensitive information and should be considered separately. However, there are steps that can be taken to increase one's privacy and security online.

### Privacy and Security Through Encryption

One way to keep personal information private is to use encryption. Encryption is the process of converting plain text into coded language that is unreadable without the correct decryption key. This can be done at the level of individual files or messages, as well as at the level of entire storage devices (hard drives and pen drives) and entire communications networks (using SSL encryption protocols and encrypted emails).

Encryption is a technique used to protect sensitive information from unauthorised access, and it is used in many different ways in everyday life. Some examples include:

1. **Online banking and shopping:** When you use your credit card to make a purchase online, the information is encrypted so that it cannot be intercepted by hackers.
2. **Email:** Many email providers use encryption to protect the content of your messages as they travel from your device to the recipient's device. However, remember to ensure the person or service receiving your data also uses encryption. If not, when you send an encrypted email, the output on the other end might be stored in plaintext formats.
3. **Instant messaging:** Popular instant messaging apps like WhatsApp and Signal use end-to-end encryption to protect the content of your conversations. However, consider who owns the messaging platforms and where the main portion of their revenue comes from: Meta (previously Facebook) own WhatsApp which has been integrated with the main Facebook platform for advertising and commercial reasons (i.e., profit).
4. **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs):** When you use a VPN to connect to the internet, your data is encrypted so that it cannot be intercepted by hackers or other unauthorised parties. You must make sure you trust the provider and they keep no logs of your usage. Consider services based in other countries that might have more privacy protections in place.
5. **File storage and sharing services:** Some cloud-based file storage and sharing services, such as Dropbox, use encryption to protect the files you upload. iCloud unfortunately, does not provide true end 2 end encryption, and Google Drive is operated and owned by a company who’s main focus is mass data collection (with very questionable policies and tactics).
6. **Mobile devices:** Many smartphones and tablets use encryption to protect the data stored on the device, such as contacts, photos, and messages. However, consider who developed the device and whether you should really be using it. Open Source mobile operating systems such as Graphene OS and Lineage OS offer much more privacy and security by default.

These are just a few examples of how encryption is used in everyday life. Encryption is becoming increasingly important as more and more personal and sensitive information is shared and stored online.

### Internet Browsers

Another way to increase online privacy is to use certain internet browsers that prioritise privacy, such as Tor or Brave. These browsers have built-in features that block cookies and adverts, and often have the option to use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) for added security. It is important to note, if you are connecting to public Wi-Fi hotspots, you should consider using a VPN to add more privacy but remember, using a VPN does not add more security because you do not control the entry and exit nodes of these services. Ideally, you should never connect to public Wi-Fi hotspots or insecure networks and use your mobile data or home internet services instead.

However, there are several internet browsers that are specifically designed with a focus on privacy and security. Some examples include:

1. **Tor Browser:** Tor is an open-source browser that is designed to protect users' privacy and security by routing internet traffic through a network of volunteer-run nodes. This makes it more difficult for attackers to track users' online activities. Tor also includes features such as built-in encryption and the ability to block third-party cookies.
2. **Brave:** Brave is an open-source browser that is designed to protect users' privacy by blocking third-party cookies, ads, and trackers. It also includes features such as HTTPS Everywhere and script blocking to improve security. Brave also has a built-in VPN service, which can be useful for users who want to protect their online activities from being tracked by their ISP.
3. **Firefox:** Firefox is an open-source browser that provides users with a range of privacy and security features. It includes features such as tracking protection, which blocks third-party trackers, and a feature called Firefox Monitor, which alerts users when their email address is involved in a data breach. Firefox also allows users to install privacy-enhancing add-ons, such as uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger.
4. **Safari:** Safari is a browser developed by Apple and is available on macOS and iOS. Safari has a feature called “Intelligent Tracking Prevention” which helps to prevent cross-site tracking by using machine learning to identify trackers and remove them.
5. **Chrome:** Chrome browser is developed by Google (an advertising company), it has a built-in feature called “Safe Browsing” which helps to protect users from phishing and malware attacks. Chrome also has an incognito mode which prevents the browser from storing browsing history, search history, and cookies.

It is important to use a secure and privacy-focused browser because it can help protect users from various online threats, such as phishing, malware, and tracking by third-party companies. Using a browser that includes features such as built-in encryption, tracking protection, and ad-blocking can help to keep users' online activities private and secure.

It is important to be aware of telemetry issues when choosing a browser or other software. Telemetry refers to the collection and reporting of data about the performance, usage, and operation of a product. Some companies, such as Google, may collect telemetry data from their users in order to improve their products and services. However, this data collection can also include personal information such as browsing history and search queries, which can be a concern for users who value their privacy.

To avoid these issues, users should consider using open-source browsers or software that does not collect telemetry data or have an explicit opt-in telemetry feature (Firefox as standard enables this by default even though it is seen as a big player in privacy protections). Also, users should be aware of the privacy policy of the software they are using and understand what data is being collected and how it is being used.

It's also important to stay away from software developed by advertising companies, such as Google, as these companies may collect data on users' browsing habits and search queries in order to serve targeted ads. This data collection can also include personal information and it's not only a privacy concern but also it could lead to a lack of trust in the company.

Another factor to consider with your internet browsers is the ease of which a user can store login information or remain logged into services even when the browser is closed. This would allow many service providers to monitor everything you are doing. An example would be remaining logged into Google services and carrying out searches, or allowing other people to use your device carrying out searches and visiting websites. This could and would allow Google to monitor all your search terms, websites visited (either by you or another person), follow you around the internet (including physical location data) no matter what device you use, and sell this information to third-parties which also wish to accomplish the same objectives to either sell you a product or service, or use your data and sell it… making you the product.

In summary, users should be aware of telemetry issues when choosing a browser or other software, and consider using open-source software that does not collect telemetry data or have an explicit opt-in feature. Additionally, users should be wary of software developed by advertising companies and understand their privacy policy to protect their personal information.

### Encrypted DNS (Domain Name System)

Additionally, using an Encrypted DNS can help protect against DNS leaks, which can reveal a user's browsing history to third parties. It also helps protect against man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker intercepts and alters network traffic.

Encrypted DNS (Domain Name System) is a technique used to protect internet users from malicious actors who may intercept and redirect their internet traffic to malicious sites. It works by encrypting the communications between a user's device and the DNS server, making it more difficult for attackers to intercept and redirect traffic.

One measure that has been taken to improve DNS security is the use of DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions). DNSSEC is a set of extensions to the DNS protocol that add security to the DNS infrastructure. It allows DNS resolvers to authenticate DNS responses, ensuring that the responses are coming from the legitimate source and have not been tampered with.

Another measure that has been taken is the use of DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over TLS (DoT). These protocols encrypt the communications between a user's device and the DNS server, making it more difficult for attackers to intercept and redirect traffic.

There are several services and software available that support encrypted DNS. Some examples include:

1. **Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1:** A free, fast, and private DNS resolver that supports DNS over HTTPS and DNS over TLS.
2. **Quad9:** A free, fast and secure DNS resolver that blocks malicious domains and supports DNSSEC
3. **OpenDNS:** A free, fast and secure DNS resolver that block malicious domains and supports DNSSEC
4. **Google Public DNS:** A free, global Domain Name System (DNS) resolution service that you can use as an alternative to your current DNS provider.
5. **DNS over HTTPS client:** Firefox, Chrome and Edge browser have implemented DNS over HTTPS feature by default.

These are just a few examples of services and software that support encrypted DNS. By using encrypted DNS, internet users can help protect themselves from malicious actors (even your ISP can monitor everything you do and the devices you use, selling this data multiple times) who may intercept and redirect their internet traffic to malicious sites. There are many internet browsers allowing you to integrate encrypted DNS (DNS over HTTPS) as standard such as Firefox.

### Staying Away from Free Email Providers (without E2EE)

Staying away from free email providers, such as Google Mail, can also help protect privacy as these companies often collect and use personal data for targeted advertising (scanning your email and documents/attachments). Instead, opting for email providers that offer true end-to-end encryption can help keep messages private and secure (for example, Proton Mail) and free from advertiser’s prying eyes.

### What Do Advertisers Normally Do?

Advertisers can use personal data to create targeted advertising campaigns that are tailored to specific individuals. This data can be collected through a variety of means, such as cookies, web tracking, and social media activity across multiple devices and locations. Advertisers can also purchase data from third-party companies that specialise in collecting and selling personal information (sometimes, scraping your social media content too).

When a person uses other websites, advertisers may use this data to track their browsing habits, interests, and demographics. This information is then used to display personalised ads on the websites that the person visits. For example, if a person frequently searches for running shoes, they may start seeing ads for running shoes on other websites they visit (including text, audio and video content).

The impact of these targeted, personalised advertising techniques on a person can vary depending on the individual. Some may find it useful and convenient, as they are only seeing ads that are relevant to their interests. However, others often find it invasive and feel as though their privacy is being compromised (with certain service providers demanding access in order to use their service – no opt-out options provided). Additionally, targeted advertising can also lead to a filter bubble, where a person is only exposed to information and perspectives that align with their already established views and interests, limiting their exposure to new ideas and perspectives. It is important to recognise, the more data you hand over, the more related content will be tailored to you. This can have negative impacts for everybody concerned as recently presented across global media. Some algorithms developed by organisations are no longer in control of the company and certain organisations have stated publicly, they are no longer in control.

### Cloud Storage Providers

Another way to protect privacy is to avoid using cloud storage unless you are the only one controlling the encryption security keys (Apple save your decryption keys with your data in the cloud – this is not true end 2 end encryption as Apple and anybody they share your data with can decrypt your private data – often without your knowledge subject to non-disclosure and gagging orders). By avoiding these types of services and using true end 2 end encryption, it can help prevent data breaches and unauthorised access to your personal information.

Some cloud storage providers may claim to offer encryption for the data that is stored on their servers, but it is important to note that not all encryption is created equal. Some providers may only offer client-side encryption, which means that the data is encrypted on the user's device before it is uploaded to the cloud. While this can provide some level of protection, it is still vulnerable to attacks on the cloud storage provider's servers.

Other providers may offer server-side encryption, but the encryption keys may be held by the provider, which means that they have access to the decryption keys and can therefore access the data. This can be a concern for users who are storing sensitive information and want to ensure that it is not accessed by unauthorised parties.

Additionally, some cloud storage providers may use user data for other purposes, such as targeted advertising or sharing with third-party companies. This is why it is important to read the terms of service and privacy policy of a provider before uploading your personal data files.

It's also important to always keep a backup of your personal data files. This means that if the cloud storage provider experiences a data breach or the data is otherwise lost or stolen, you will still have a copy of the data. You can store backups in multiple places, such as an external hard drive, a different cloud storage provider, or even on a physical medium such as a USB drive (make sure you encrypt your backups for additional privacy).

### Operating Systems

Finally, using privacy-focused operating systems such as Tails OS and Qubes OS (not Microsoft Windows, Google Android, and Mac OS) can provide an added layer of security to daily routines. These operating systems are specifically designed to protect against surveillance and tracking, and are often used by activists, journalists, and other individuals who need to keep their online activities private. However, more people in the general public are turning towards a more secure and privacy focused operating system due to recent and past revelations.

### Tails OS

Tails, also known as The Amnesic Incognito Live System, is a free and open-source operating system that is designed to preserve privacy and anonymity. It is based on the Debian GNU/Linux distribution and is built to be run from a USB drive or DVD.

One of the key benefits of using Tails is that it routes all internet traffic through the Tor network, which helps to conceal the user's IP address and location. Additionally, Tails does not save any data on the computer's hard drive, ensuring that no trace of the user's activities is left behind. This makes it a useful tool for journalists, activists, and anyone else who needs to protect their online identity and communications. Additionally, Tails comes with a variety of privacy-enhancing tools, such as the encrypted messaging app, "pidgin" and the encrypted email client, "claws mail" and other apps that can help to protect the user's privacy and security.

### Qubes OS

Qubes OS is a free and open-source operating system that focuses on providing added security for its users. It uses a virtualization-based approach to security, where each task or application runs in its own isolated virtual machine. This allows for a more secure and compartmentalized system, as any potential security breaches or malware will be contained within the affected virtual machine and will not be able to spread to other parts of the system.

One of the key benefits of using Qubes OS is its use of "qubes," or isolated virtual machines, for different tasks or applications. For example, one qube can be used for browsing the internet while another qube can be used for online banking. This allows for added security, as any potential malware or security breaches on the internet browsing qube will not be able to access the online banking qube. Additionally, Qubes OS also includes features such as AppArmor and firewalling to further enhance security. Overall, Qubes OS provides a highly secure and customizable environment for users who prioritise the protection of their personal and sensitive information.

### Windows & Google Android

Microsoft Windows and others such as Google Android are well known to implement telemetries and information gathering (fingerprinting) techniques at the system level. This means, many options cannot be uninstalled or even turned off without crippling the operating system. This suggests an all or nothing policy to personal and corporate data collection employed by certain software development companies.

You will undoubtedly come across resources advising to use these operating systems in a virtual machine (VMware, VirtualBox). However, it is important to note, your new OS is only as secure as the one you are running the virtualisation software on. The host operating system (commonly Windows) could be compromised ultimately putting at risk your new more secure and privacy focused OS. Tails OS and Qubes OS clearly state on documentation this should not be done. You could inadvertently compromise your privacy and security as a result.

### Security and Privacy Conclusion

In conclusion, online privacy and security is a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach. By using encryption, privacy-focused browsers and VPNs, encrypted DNS, avoiding free email providers that do not prioritise a privacy first approach, not using cloud storage if you are not the only one controlling the security keys, and using privacy-focused and security-focused operating systems like Tails OS and Qubes OS (both Linux based) and more secure mobile devices running Lineage OS or Graphene OS, individuals can take steps to protect their personal information and keep their online activities private, whilst also adding additional security and privacy enhancements.

Ideally, software developers and hardware manufacturers will develop a privacy-first and security-first approach to all future and existing projects. However, this takes time, requires major changes in workflow policies and practises, and would cost the companies a large portion of their profits. This is one of the many reasons why there has been a slow uptake in these privacy-first/security-first approaches by organisations and why there needs to be personal responsibility on the user’s part. History has told us many times over, we are unable to wait for companies to make these changes and even when they do, not everything may seem as it should with hidden practices and stealthy techniques hitting the headlines on a regular basis.

Educate your friends and your family because together, we can make positive changes which will undoubtedly force the hands of organisations whom otherwise, seem focused on profits over our rights to a more secure and privacy focused environment. Even if you feel you have ‘nothing to hide’ (a common misconception promoted by governments, and data mining companies), you should be exercising your fundamental rights to live an uninterrupted, secure, and private life without interference and tampering. After all, this notion is written into many laws which we all rely on to live peacefully throughout our daily lives.

It would also be prudent to check the bibliography list of these books to find more sources about the topic. Also, some websites such as the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), and the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) provide resources and information on privacy and security topics.

It's also worth noting that research papers, articles and journals on topics such as information security, computer science, and privacy law can be found in academic databases such as JSTOR, ProQuest, and ACM Digital Library. These articles can provide a more in-depth analysis and expert perspective on specific privacy and security topics.

Here are some examples of research papers, articles, and journals that focus on privacy and security:

- "A Privacy-Preserving and Lightweight Authentication Protocol for the Internet of Things" by X. Wang, Y. Liu and S. Lu. Published in IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing.
- "Security and Privacy in Social Networks" by M. K. Reiter and A. D. Rubin. Published in ACM Computing Surveys.

- "The Privacy-Security Trade-Off" by R. A. Spinello and H. Nissenbaum. Published in IEEE Security & Privacy.

You can find more research papers, articles and journals by searching academic databases such as JSTOR, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect and ACM Digital Library, using keywords such as "privacy", "security", "cybersecurity", "data privacy" and "information security".

It is also worth noting that many conferences and symposiums such as the IEEE International Conference on Privacy, Security, Risk and Trust (PASSAT), the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS), and the Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS) have proceedings that are published and can be used as a source of research papers and articles on privacy and security topics.

As well as that, you can check some governmental websites such as the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) of the UK, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) of the US and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC) which provides resources and guidance on cybersecurity and privacy matters.

Here are some examples of privacy laws that govern the collection, use, and protection of personal information:

- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):** The GDPR is a data protection law that applies to individuals within the European Union (EU). It regulates the collection, storage, and use of personal data, and gives individuals the right to access, correct, and delete their personal data.
- **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA):** The CCPA is a data privacy law that applies to businesses operating in California. It gives California residents the right to know what personal information is being collected about them, the right to request that their personal information be deleted, and the right to opt-out of the sale of their personal information.
- **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA):** The HIPAA is a federal law that governs the collection, storage, and use of protected health information (PHI) in the United States. It requires healthcare providers and other covered entities to implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI.
- **Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA):** The PIPEDA is a federal data protection law that applies to private sector organizations in Canada. It sets out the ground rules for the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information in a commercial context.
- **Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA):** The COPPA is a federal law that applies to websites and online services that are directed at children under the age of 13 in the United States. It requires these sites and services to obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting, using, or disclosing personal information from children.
- **Network and Information Systems Security Directive (NISD):** The NISD is a law that applies to organizations that operate critical infrastructure in the European Union. It requires organizations to take appropriate measures to ensure the security of their network and information systems and to report certain types of security incidents to the relevant authorities.

These are just a few examples of privacy laws, and there are many more laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, and protection of personal information. It's important to be aware of the laws that apply to your organisation or industry and to comply with them to protect personal information and avoid penalties.

Here are some examples of security development policies and practices that are commonly used to protect software systems and applications:

- **Secure Coding:** This is the practice of writing code that is free from security vulnerabilities and follows best practices for secure coding. This includes avoiding common coding mistakes such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and buffer overflow.
- **Threat modelling:** This is the process of identifying potential security threats to a system or application, and determining how to mitigate them. This includes identifying assets, identifying potential threats, and determining how to protect against them.
- **Code reviews:** This is the practice of reviewing code for security vulnerabilities and other issues before it is released. This includes using automated tools to identify vulnerabilities and manual review by other developers.
- **Penetration testing:** This is the process of simulating an attack on a system or application in order to identify vulnerabilities and other security issues. This includes using automated tools and manual testing to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Security testing:** This is the process of testing software for security vulnerabilities and other issues. This includes testing for common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and buffer overflow.
- **Incident Response:** This is the process of identifying, responding, and recovering from a security incident. This includes creating a plan to mitigate and handle security issues.

Hopefully, the above detailed references and further reading section will give you plenty of research topics to enhance your understanding of privacy and security issues. Please take your privacy and security as a serious topic to understand. If we ignore these fundamental rights and developments, the closer we become to losing them; leading to a new societal normality of privacy invasion and insecure devices being widely accepted. The saying goes, ‘If you have nothing to hide, why should you be worried or concerned’ and this is fundamentally an incorrect methodology to adopt.
