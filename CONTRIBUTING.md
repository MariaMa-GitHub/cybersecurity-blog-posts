Contributing to the Cybersecurity Blog Posts Repo

This repository has been created to store copies of all articles posted on the main cybersecurity website. This allows us to have a backup of all articles published, and provides a great first issue concept for those beginning on their GitHub journey.

**What will this contribution require:**

Getting involved in this repository is primarily aimed at those just starting out on their GitHub journey. It will present a great opportunity to learn the basics of using GitHub, and understanding core concepts. It will also allow you to open up certain GitHub achievement badges on your profile.

**Example steps for contribution:**

* Visit the TODO.md page
* Choose an article to copy across
* Visit the main cybersecurity blog
* Copy content of chosen article into this repository

**Warning: non-trivial pull requests (anything such as fixing a typo)
will be closed!** `Please create an issue` to suggest such changes.

[Create New Issue](https://github.com/ProfCyberNaught/cybersecurity-blog-posts/issues "Create New Issue")

Cybersecurity Blog Posts uses GitHub to keep track of bugs, feature requests, and associated
patches because GitHub now provides enough adequate tooling for its community.
Patches can be submitted as pull requests, but if you don't create an issue,
it's unlikely that we'll notice your contribution or accept it. Please make sure you
document your contributions well enough for us to understand the changes.

Contributing to the Cybersecurity Project
=========================================

If you wish to get involved in this project and copy over one of the articles from the main cybersecurity blog, you must follow the below steps to complete the process.
