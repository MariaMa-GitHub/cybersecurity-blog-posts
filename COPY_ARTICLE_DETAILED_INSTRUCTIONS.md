Detailed Instructions - Copying a Cybersecurity Article
=======================================================

This more detailed set of instructions has been created to assist those whom might need further instructions to help create a backup copy of a Cybersecurity Blog Article taken from the [main website](https://profcybernaught.hashnode.dev/ "Cybersecurity Blog - ProfCyberNaught").

You will find screenshots of the different sections using an example main website article post, screenshots of the `blank_article_layout_template.md` file, along with the locations for each data type, and example results for those sections.

**What will this detailed contribution instructions cover:**

This more detailed set of instructions aims to cover the main step called `USING THE BLANK ARTICLE TEMPLATE FILE - STEP 2` over on the main [CONTRIBUTING.md file](./CONTRIBUTING.md "Contributing to the Cybersecurity Blog Article Backup Repository - ProfCyberNaught"). We suggest having the main steps open along side this detailed set of instructions. Both documents are aimed at helping you achieve your first contribution to a GitHub repository.

Copying the Article Content
===========================

Make sure you have already chosen which Cybersecurity blog article you would like to create a backup copy of: `CHOOSING AN ARTICLE`. Make sure you have checked the `MAKE AN ARTICLE COPY` issue for comments that might have already stated, somebody is copying this blog article.

### Assumptions Made
We make the following assumptions about you:

- You can speak English as per these instructions
- You have registered for a GitHub account already
- You are logged into your account via your chosen internet browser
- You have read the additional information presented in the links below _(or at least will refer to it if required)_
- You are familiar enough with your chosen operating system _(Windows, MacOS, Linux)_
- You understand how to copy and paste data
- You already have a text editor or _(IDE - Integrated Development Environment)_ code editor installed
- You have Git, Github, GitHub Desktop installed or are using the web client interface
- You have an active internet connection to view the main Cybersecurity website

**IDE Suggestion:**<br />
We suggest using an official code editor such as VSCodium, VSCode, Notepad++, Sublime Text and more. However, a standard text editor such as `Notepad(Windows)`, `GEdit(Linux)` or `TextEdit(MacOS)` will work just fine. Be careful about adding text formatting and saving as a different file type _(must be `.md`)_.<br /><br />
We use Markdown for these pages and a link has been provided below with more additional instructions and examples.

**_PRIVACY ADVISORY NOTICE:_**
<br />_**VSCode** has <ins>Microsoft telemetry activated by default</ins>. You can turn this off in the File > Options window. **VSCodium** <ins>does not</ins> have the Microsoft telemetry activated by default. Both are based on open-source software and free to use._<br />

_**GitHub Desktop** also has <ins>Microsoft telemetry activated by default</ins>. This can also be disabled in the settings: File > Options > Advanced > Usage. This is also open-source software, although GitHub itself is closed-source._
<br /><br />

    Unfortunately, there are other telemetry behaviours within your chosen operating system and/or software packages installed. Make sure you do your own research if you value your privacy like we do.
<br />

**Please use the below instructions to copy the article content:**
<br /><br />

For the purpose of this detailed documentation, we have selected to use a particular Cybersecurity article called: `Not Everything is a 'Click Fix'!`. An example of what this article looks like in the main Cybersecurity website feed has been provided below:

![article_feature_feed.png](./pcn_images/article_detailed_instructions_documentation/website_article/article_feature_feed.png "Article Example Feed - article_feature_feed.png")

To view this article, you can click the following link: [View Article](https://profcybernaught.hashnode.dev/not-everything-is-a-click-fix "Not Everything is a 'Click Fix'! - Cybersecurity Blog - ProfCyberNaught")

We have also used another article for the reference section because the one linked above, does not contain any references. You can view this Cybersecurity article called `An Overview of Leet (1337) Speak: History, Usage, and Implications` by clicking the following link: [View Article](https://profcybernaught.hashnode.dev/an-overview-of-leet-1337-speak-history-usage-and-implications "An Overview of Leet (1337) Speak: History, Usage, and Implications - Cybersecurity Blog - ProfCyberNaught")
<br /><br />

#### THE ARTICLE TITLE
The article title can be found at the very top of the main article website page. The below image displays the top of an article page named: `Not Everything is a 'Click Fix'!`. [View Article](https://profcybernaught.hashnode.dev/not-everything-is-a-click-fix "Not Everything is a 'Click Fix'! - Cybersecurity Blog - ProfCyberNaught")

![article_header_section.png](./pcn_images/article_detailed_instructions_documentation/website_article/article_header_section.png "Article Title - article_header_section.png")

You can copy the title text and paste this into the `blank template file` title section displayed in the image below:

![article_template_title.png](./pcn_images/article_detailed_instructions_documentation/article_template_file/article_template_title.png "Article Title - article_template_title.png")

Replace `[ARTICLE-TITLE]` with the copied title text:

```
# Not Everything is a 'Click Fix'!
```

<br /><br />

#### THE ARTICLE SUBTITLE
The article subtitle can be found directly underneath the main article title. The below image displays the top of an article page named: `Not Everything is a 'Click Fix'!`. [View Article](https://profcybernaught.hashnode.dev/not-everything-is-a-click-fix "Not Everything is a 'Click Fix'! - Cybersecurity Blog - ProfCyberNaught")

![article_header_section.png](./pcn_images/article_detailed_instructions_documentation/website_article/article_header_section.png "Article Title - article_header_section.png")

You can copy the title text and paste this into the `blank template file` subtitle section displayed in the image below:

![article_template_subtitle.png](./pcn_images/article_detailed_instructions_documentation/article_template_file/article_template_subtitle.png "Article Subtitle - article_template_subtitle.png")

Replace `[ARTICLE-SUBTITLE]` with the copied title text:

```
## Not every tech thing is easy to fix
```
<br /><br />

#### THE ARTICLE CONTENT
The article body content can be found directly underneath the header section detailed above. The below image displays the main body content from the article page named: `Not Everything is a 'Click Fix'!`. [View Article](https://profcybernaught.hashnode.dev/not-everything-is-a-click-fix "Not Everything is a 'Click Fix'! - Cybersecurity Blog - ProfCyberNaught")

![article_content_body_section.png](./pcn_images/article_detailed_instructions_documentation/website_article/article_content_body_section.png "Article Main Content - article_content_body_section.png")

You can copy the main body content text and paste this into the `blank template file` content section displayed in the image below:

![article_template_subtitle.png](./pcn_images/article_detailed_instructions_documentation/article_template_file/article_template_content.png "Article Subtitle - article_template_subtitle.png")

Replace `[ARTICLE-CONTENT]` with the copied body content text:

```
The term "click fix" refers to the idea that many non-technical people assume that any problem related to technology can be easily solved with just a few clicks. This is a play on the phrase "quick fix," which implies that a problem can be solved quickly and easily. The term 'click fix' is generally used in either photography for taking photos, or construction to enable a click-fix mechanism to attach two objects (essentially, in a quick manner). Prof Cyber Naught uses this term and relates it to the area of consumer understanding within the technical support industry.

Many non-technical or non-IT peeps seem to have the understanding, just because somebody works in tech, they know how to fix things quickly. Instructions would go along the lines of... just a click here, just a click there... and DONE! In some simple scenarios, this can be the exact case.

However, this is often not the case. Many issues related to technology are complex and cannot be resolved with just a few clicks. They may require extensive troubleshooting, programming, or even a complete redesign or reboot of the system.

Non-technical people need to understand that technology professionals are not magicians who can make problems disappear with the click of a button. Many times, resolving a technical issue requires a significant amount of time and expertise.

Additionally, it's important for technology professionals to communicate effectively with non-technical people and to set realistic expectations about the time and effort required to fix a problem.

In short, not everything is a "click fix" in the world of technology and both technical and non-technical individuals need to understand and accept this reality.

"Click Fix" - ProfCyberNaught
```

**IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:**<br />
You must pay attention to the article content and whether or not this content has `bold text`, `italic text`, `underlined text`, potential `links` to other pages and websites, `lists`, `quotes` and more.

<ins>In our example article used above</ins>, we can see from the main article content, we have <ins>bold text twice</ins> in the first paragraph, <ins>italics</ins> in the third paragraph, and the last sentence is all <ins>bold</ins>.

#### BOLD TEXT
When trying to use bold text, we need to add characters before and after the specific text to be made bold. In order to do this, we need to use the `asterisk symbol (*)` twice as follows:

Paragraph One:
```
The term **"click fix"** refers to the idea that many non-technical people assume that any problem related to technology can be easily solved with just a few clicks. This is a play on the phrase **"quick fix,"** which implies ... ... ...
```

Last Sentence:
```
**"Click Fix" - ProfCyberNaught**
```

#### ITALIC TEXT
When trying to use italic text, we need to add characters before and after the specific text to be made italic. In order to do this, we need to use the `underscore symbol (_)` as follows:

Paragraph Three:
```
However, this is _often not_ the case. Many issues ... ... ...
```

**FAQ: What about other content types?**<br />
If there are other types of content within your chosen article, it would be best to refer to the [Basic Syntax - Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/ "Basic Syntax - Markdown Guide") linked above. This covers many different methods of adding content types using Markdown.

However, if you would like some more examples displayed in the layout method used here, you can visit our [Example Markdown Methods](# "") page.
<br /><br />

#### THE ARTICLE KEYWORDS
The article keywords can be found directly underneath the main article content. The below image displays the keywords section of an article page named: `Not Everything is a 'Click Fix'!`. [View Article](https://profcybernaught.hashnode.dev/not-everything-is-a-click-fix "Not Everything is a 'Click Fix'! - Cybersecurity Blog - ProfCyberNaught")

![article_header_section.png](./pcn_images/article_detailed_instructions_documentation/website_article/article_keyword_section.png "Article Title - article_header_section.png")

You can copy each individual keyword and paste them into the `blank template file` keyword fields section displayed in the image below:

![article_template_subtitle.png](./pcn_images/article_detailed_instructions_documentation/article_template_file/article_template_keywords.png "Article Subtitle - article_template_subtitle.png")

Replace `[KEYWORD-1]` and the other four with the copied keyword text:

```
#### KEYWORD TAGS: | Technical Support | #cybersecurity | cybersecurity | computer | click fix |
```
<ins>**_KEYWORD NOTICE:_**</ins> _Some keywords might look like they are repeated but using the `pound symbol(#)`, also commonly known as the `hash symbol(#)` on social media, or the `money symbol(#)` elsewhere. This is not a typo and refers to a different registered keyword type on the Hashnode website platform. As such, as in our example above, please make sure you still copy these including the symbol.<br /><br />
__*__ **All articles will contain five keywords in total!**_
<br /><br />

#### THE ARTICLE REFERENCES (FURTHER READING)
The article references section _(if your chosen article has one)_ can be found directly above the keyword section. The below image displays the reference section of an article page named: `An Overview of Leet (1337) Speak: History, Usage, and Implications`. [View Article](https://profcybernaught.hashnode.dev/an-overview-of-leet-1337-speak-history-usage-and-implications "An Overview of Leet (1337) Speak: History, Usage, and Implications - Cybersecurity Blog - ProfCyberNaught")

![article_header_section.png](./pcn_images/article_detailed_instructions_documentation/website_article/article_reference_section.png "Article Title - article_header_section.png")

The reference section normally uses a an unordered list format and can be accomplished in Markdown by adding a `hyphen symbol(-)` at the beginning of each reference line used.

You can copy the reference text and paste this into the `blank template file` reference section displayed in the image below:

![article_template_subtitle.png](./pcn_images/article_detailed_instructions_documentation/article_template_file/article_template_references.png "Article Subtitle - article_template_subtitle.png")

Replace `[REFERENCE-1]` with the first copied reference text, and repeat for as many as you need. We have provided four placeholders `[REFERENCE-X]` within the template. However, just add more using the `hyphen symbol(-)` when needed. Here is what our example reference section looks like from the article used for demonstration purposes:

```
- Raymond, E. S. (1996). The New Hacker's Dictionary. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.
- Kamvar, S. D., Haveliwala, T. H., & Garcia-Molina, H. (2003). The EigenTrust Algorithm for Reputation Management in P2P
- Steinkuehler, C. (2006). Leet Speak and Online Communities. Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 11(3).
- Bruns, A. (2008). Leet Speak and Online Censorship
```

<ins>**_NOTICE:_**</ins> _There must be a space between the `hyphen symbol(-)` used and the beginning of the reference text. This can be see in the `blank template file`._

**FAQ: What if my chosen article does not have a reference section?**<br />
If your chosen article does not contain any references, as per the commented instructions with the `blank template file`, you can delete all content between the reference tags: `<!-- REFERENCES -->` _(including the tags themselves)_.

<br /><br />

#### THE BLANK TEMPLATE FOOTER TABLE
The `blank template file` contains a table at the bottom which contains all the important information about the article, and yourself _(the person who copied the article over from the main Cybersecurity website)_. All copied articles must have this table populated with the correct data, including a link to your very own GitHub profile page.

Here is what the Footer Table looks like within the `blank template file`:

![article_header_section.png](./pcn_images/article_detailed_instructions_documentation/article_template_file/article_template_footer_table.png "Article Title - article_header_section.png")

<ins>**_HELP NOTICE:_**</ins> _This is where many beginner contributors struggle. We have tried to provide as much detail as possible. However, if you still find yourself struggling, please leave a comment on the repository issue, and we will get back to you and provide additional support if required._

Within this footer table, we use some variable placeholders to help you place your copied data into the correct locations. These consist of the following:

- `[PUBLISHED-DATE]`
- `[[ARTICLE-TITLE-HERE]]`
- `[ARTICLE-TITLE-URL]`
- `[COPIED-OVER-DATE]`
- `[[YOUR-GITHUB-URL-USERNAME]]`
- `[YOUR-GITHUB-URL]`

#### SETTING THE 'PUBLISHED-DATE' VARIABLE
The published date can be found by looking at the header of the chosen Cybersecurity article. This is normally displayed in the following format: `Jan 22, 2023`.

Simply, replace `[PUBLISHED-DATE]` with the correct date by copying the date and pasting into the `blank template file`. An example of what the table should look like so far has been provided below:

```
| Jan 22, 2023 | [[ARTICLE-TITLE-HERE]]([ARTICLE-TITLE-URL] "[ARTICLE-TITLE-HERE]") | [Read License](./LICENSE.md "License Agreement - Cybersecurity Blog - ProfCyberNaught") | [COPIED-OVER-DATE] | [[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME]]([YOUR-GITHUB-URL] "[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME] on GitHub") | [ProfCyberNaught](https://github.com/ProfCyberNaught "ProfCyberNaught on GitHub") |
```

#### SETTING THE 'ARTICLE-TITLE-HERE' VARIABLES
The article title can be found by looking at the header of the chosen Cybersecurity article. This is normally displayed at the very top. we have already covered this in a previous instruction above.

You will notice, this variable placeholder has two sets of `square brackets[[ ]]`. This is not a typo but simply a function of the Markdown syntax. When adding your copied data, you must leave the first set of `square brackets[]` intact.

Here is an example of what the table should look like using our example Cybersecurity article data:

```
| Jan 22, 2023 | [Not Everything is a 'Click Fix'!]([ARTICLE-TITLE-URL] "[ARTICLE-TITLE-HERE]") | [Read License](./LICENSE.md "License Agreement - Cybersecurity Blog - ProfCyberNaught") | [COPIED-OVER-DATE] | [[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME]]([YOUR-GITHUB-URL] "[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME] on GitHub") | [ProfCyberNaught](https://github.com/ProfCyberNaught "ProfCyberNaught on GitHub") |
```

Notice the data still has the first square brackets as follows: `[Not Everything is a 'Click Fix'!]`.

We have another instance of the `[ARTICLE-TITLE-HERE]` but this time, it only has one set of `square brackets[]`. Again, this is intentional and you need to replace the variable placeholder _(including the brackets this time)_ with your article title.

An example of what the footer table should look like with the above changes has been provided below:

```
| Jan 22, 2023 | [Not Everything is a 'Click Fix'!]([ARTICLE-TITLE-URL] "Not Everything is a 'Click Fix'!") | [Read License](./LICENSE.md "License Agreement - Cybersecurity Blog - ProfCyberNaught") | [COPIED-OVER-DATE] | [[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME]]([YOUR-GITHUB-URL] "[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME] on GitHub") | [ProfCyberNaught](https://github.com/ProfCyberNaught "ProfCyberNaught on GitHub") |
```

#### SETTING THE 'COPIED-OVER-DATE' VARIABLE
This refers to the date you copied over the Cybersecurity article. If todays date is currently _'Wednesday the 15th March 2023'_, then you would need to replace the variable placeholder with `Mar 15, 2023`.

Here is an example of what the table should look like with all the steps completed so far:

```
| Jan 22, 2023 | [Not Everything is a 'Click Fix'!]([ARTICLE-TITLE-URL] "Not Everything is a 'Click Fix'!") | [Read License](./LICENSE.md "License Agreement - Cybersecurity Blog - ProfCyberNaught") | Mar 15, 2023 | [[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME]]([YOUR-GITHUB-URL] "[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME] on GitHub") | [ProfCyberNaught](https://github.com/ProfCyberNaught "ProfCyberNaught on GitHub") |
```

#### SETTING THE 'ARTICLE-TITLE-URL' VARIABLE
This refers to the website link url which is displayed in the address bar of your internet browser for the main Cybersecurity website. Here is what it should look like for our example Cybersecurity article:

![article_url_link_example.png](./pcn_images/article_detailed_instructions_documentation/website_article/article_url_link_example.png "Main Article URL - article_url_link_example.png")

You will need to copy this link _(making sure it starts with the `https`)_ and replace the variable placeholder `[ARTICLE-TITLE-URL]`.

Here is an example of what the table should look like with all the steps completed so far:

```
| Jan 22, 2023 | [Not Everything is a 'Click Fix'!](https://profcybernaught.hashnode.dev/not-everything-is-a-click-fix "Not Everything is a 'Click Fix'!") | [Read License](./LICENSE.md "License Agreement - Cybersecurity Blog - ProfCyberNaught") | Mar 15, 2023 | [[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME]]([YOUR-GITHUB-URL] "[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME] on GitHub") | [ProfCyberNaught](https://github.com/ProfCyberNaught "ProfCyberNaught on GitHub") |
```

#### SETTING THE 'YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME' VARIABLES
This is where you get to place your own GitHub profile account name. This is our way of saying thank you for taking the time to contribute to this repository, and copying over an article written by ProfCyberNaught from the main Cybersecurity website.

If you visit your GitHub profile page, you will see your account profile username in the address bar. For ProfCyberNaught, we have included an example screenshot of the address bar for the GitHub profile account page:

![github_profile_link.png](./pcn_images/article_detailed_instructions_documentation/github_link/github_profile_link.png "ProfCyberNaught GitHub Profile Link - github_profile_link.png")

You will need to copy everything after `https://github.com/` which for ProfCyberNaught's profile link, should look like this: `ProfCyberNaught` and replace the variable placeholders `[[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME]]`, and `[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME]`.

<ins>**Remember**</ins> the double `square brackets[[ ]]` from ealier?

The first instance of the variable placeholder has the double `square brackets[[ ]]` again. Make sure you leave the first set of square brackets intact as follows: `[ProfCyberNaught]`.

The second instance only has a single set of `square brackets[]` and must be replaced as follows: `ProfCyberNaught`.

Here is an example of what the table should look like with all the steps completed so far:

```
| Jan 22, 2023 | [Not Everything is a 'Click Fix'!](https://profcybernaught.hashnode.dev/not-everything-is-a-click-fix "Not Everything is a 'Click Fix'!") | [Read License](./LICENSE.md "License Agreement - Cybersecurity Blog - ProfCyberNaught") | Mar 15, 2023 | [ProfCyberNaught]([YOUR-GITHUB-URL] "ProfCyberNaught on GitHub") | [ProfCyberNaught](https://github.com/ProfCyberNaught "ProfCyberNaught on GitHub") |
```

#### SETTING THE 'YOUR-GITHUB-URL' VARIABLES
This should be a simple task considering we have just looked at the GitHub profile URL in the above step. This time, you will need to copy the whole URL and replace the `[YOUR-GITHUB-URL]` variable placeholder.

![github_profile_link.png](./pcn_images/article_detailed_instructions_documentation/github_link/github_profile_link.png "ProfCyberNaught GitHub Profile Link - github_profile_link.png")

You will need to copy everything which should look like this: `https://github.com/ProfCyberNaught` and replace the variable placeholder `[YOUR-GITHUB-URL]`.

Here is an example of what the table should look like with all the steps completed for the footer table:

```
| Jan 22, 2023 | [Not Everything is a 'Click Fix'!](https://profcybernaught.hashnode.dev/not-everything-is-a-click-fix "Not Everything is a 'Click Fix'!") | [Read License](./LICENSE.md "License Agreement - Cybersecurity Blog - ProfCyberNaught") | Mar 15, 2023 | [ProfCyberNaught](https://github.com/ProfCyberNaught "ProfCyberNaught on GitHub") | [ProfCyberNaught](https://github.com/ProfCyberNaught "ProfCyberNaught on GitHub") |
```
Clearly, where we have been using ProfCyberNaught's GitHub profile in our examples above, you need to be using your own GitHub profile username and url data.

_Please <ins>do not change anything else in the footer table</ins> but only the variable placeholders as mentioned above._

_Your <ins>GitHub username must match your url username</ins> and cannot be changed or represented in a different way._

_We may add a link to the ProfCyberNaught GitHub profile page next to yours representing who copied the article over when the review takes place. This depends on how much assistance and changes we need to make on your behalf._
<br /><br />

#### DO NOT EDIT ABOVE OR BELOW SECTIONS
The `blank template file` contains two sections that highlight areas that must not be edited above or below. This is because the content provides important navigation links for visitors to the page you are creating.

Here is an example of the `DO NOT EDIT ABOVE THIS LINE`:

![article_template_no_edit_above.png](./pcn_images/article_detailed_instructions_documentation/article_template_file/article_template_no_edit_above.png "DO NOT EDIT ABOVE - article_template_no_edit_above.png")

Here is an example of the `DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS LINE`:

![article_template_no_edit_below.png](./pcn_images/article_detailed_instructions_documentation/article_template_file/article_template_no_edit_below.png "Article Title - article_template_no_edit_below.png")

<ins>**_IMPORTANT NOTICE:_**</ins> _If you edit anything within these sections, or remove them, the navigations on the page you are creating will not work. We will not accept copied articles with these sections removed or changed. We will leave feedback as part of the review process asking for changes to be made._

_We will try to be as helpful as we can when assisting with your support requests._

<br /><br />

#### NEXT STEPS

Now you have hopefully copied over all the required content and placed this within the `blank_article_layout_template.md` file we used above. **Remember**, make sure you have copied the template file, renamed it, and left the original template file in the repository for others to use.

You now need to refer to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md "Contributing to Copy a Cybersecurity Blog Article - ProfCyberNaught - GitHub Backup Repository") file and continue with the following step: `UPDATE TODO.md FILE`.
